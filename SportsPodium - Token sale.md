# Introduction

This document serves to outline the high-level approach, context and content of the intended TOKEN SALE for the SportsPodium product. It will define the TOKEN SALE, how funds will be deployed and the specific project timeline details.

Funds raised will enable the refraction of the solution for blockchain integration, which in turn will enable the cryptocurrency (to be named, Pods) to flow. This document will outline our needs, the application of said needs, and timelines of the project stage gates. The intended audience are pre-TOKEN SALE funders, advisors, consultants and anyone involved in enabling the TOKEN SALE to be completed successfully.

# Why A TOKEN SALE

The aim of the TOKEN SALE is three-fold. Firstly, the raising of funds allowing for the enhancement of the flow of the current solution to deal with the blockchain and cryptocurrency. Further development will be done to enhance the look and feel of the system as well as to optimise the user flows. Secondly, to raise funds for the marketing and the launching of the product. Thirdly, the TOKEN SALE will be the tool used in launching a new token, creating awareness and adding value to the token to ensure uptake once launched.

Raising a sum to the equivalent of US$ 15 Million will allow us to achieve all the above and enable the product to be launched in early 2018 whilst building the intended revenue streams for the second stage of growth. The Token Sale will be capped at $15 Million. Whilst revenue outside of the token sale will be generated from late 2018, the business should be funded for at least two years to allow time to ensure optimal chance of success and the correct revenue streams from the start of the project as well as broad and significant uptake of the platform. Funding will mainly be used for marketing into the sporting world and further development on the platform. A detailed graph of the funding spend can be seen in the attached Addendum A.

When the minimum TOKEN SALE uptake for the project reaches the equivalent of US$500 000 , the project will start. Anything less than the equivalent of US$ 15 Million raised in the token sale will mean a much slower roll-out, as time spend would then be on organically growing the business through early revenue generation. In this case, depending on the funds raised, the biggest single area of application will be marketing and promotion, which will result in fewer sports at launch, with a slower rollout rate thereafter. The company’s aim would be to reach an equivalent of US$50 Million year-on-year turnover at end of year 3, and this will be adjusted to less funds raised.

# What will we do with funds raised?

The official launch of SportsPodium is set for October 2017, directly succeeding the TOKEN SALE.

Raising the equivalent of US$ 15 Million target

Raising the full amount will allow us to have security of full operations for 36 months, a powerful marketing budget, and fully focused business to achieve the income generation objectives to ensure that after this period the business creates turnover of at least the budgeted amount per month.

## Marketing (+- 50 %)

The largest budget spend is planned for the marketing and promotion of the platform - mainly into the non-crypto world. As a result, much external guidance is needed to ensure user uptake. The approach will be strongly based on utilizing recognized sports stars and celebrities in the roles of ambassadors per sporting code. These ambassadors will be remunerated with tokens from the daily mining as well as a revenue share as part of the community’s share of all money generated from real world inflows. The recruitment of these ambassadors will take effort and money which will be covered by the initial funding sum.

Criteria for the sports ambassadors will include: sports personalities with a big social media following, this will allow us to tap into their follower base as well as their presence at grassroots level, which should have an enormous impact. The official sporting code ambassadors will be supported on a per country basis where sports code “friends” will be appointed to ensure representation in every major market. These friends will typically be local sporting heroes that will help with grassroots user adoption and mobilization. The friends will be rewarded based on the success of the specific country community and sporting code. This spider web of ambassadors and friends will ultimately be the marketers and user adoption drivers, allowing us to leverage off their strong marketing appeal.

The ongoing marketing spend will be used to continuously drive awareness and education of the platform and cryptocurrency, which will support the ambassadors through social media campaigns and also have a presence at major world events through sponsorships and advertisements.

## Development (+- 25%)

The SportsPodium solution has been developed and tested with an existing beta release, therefore allowing for the main development focus to be on the integration into the block chain, creating the reward and money flows, as well as significant focus on UI and UX elements to enhance user experience.

The minimum viable product will be quick to market, but significant enhancements will be made going forward, not only improving functionality of multi-platform support for further sporting codes, but also sub-projects for the development of an online store, an advertising engine and sports team and sport club portals.

## Other (+- 25%)

Administrative, support and management costs will make up the balance of the funding requirement and spend. Over time the business will grow and demand far more spend that will be funded out of revenue. But to launch and scale the project initially, overheads will be significantly curtailed through smart approaches such as home-based office and virtual office space.

# Funding points

To allow for various funding levels, the planned options for raising less than the set target.

## US$ 10 million

Raising this amount will ensure that the organization will be operating at full capacity for three years, with the shortfall coming out of the marketing budget and thus potentially decreasing uptake.

## US$ 5 million

Raising this amount will decrease the funded timeline to 2 years, slowing down the rollout of functionality with a far lower marketing budget, thus putting pressure on user adoption. However, the business will be fully self-funded after this period, but could take more than 5 years to reach the $50m per year turnover point.

## US$ 1 Million

The project will mainly be focused on rolling out the initial platform and then only a number of sports. Marketing will depend heavily on the impact of ambassadors, and most of the marketing budget will be focused on bringing these key stakeholders on board.

## US$ 500 000

This is the lowest amount required and will mainly ensure a small development team. Great focus will be placed on short term revenue generation, and year one would mainly be focused on looking for further investment and penetrating one sports code.

# Project roll out plan

The aim of the project is to reach market as quickly as possible, maintaining an aggressive rollout by firstly adding more sporting codes and secondly other required functionality. As we’re not starting from scratch, we estimate six months for significant UI upgrades, Blockchain integration and scaling work. There is to be a significant effort on the marketing and ambassador on-boarding process which will require at least 6 months pre-launch to mobilize, market and set up a market launch. This effort will have dedicated focus parallel to the technology work, culminating in a launch in Q2 2018.

By Q2, 2018, there will be a fully functional product in the market place that will continuously be enhanced from a functional and UI perspective. Token distribution algorithms will be tested and adjusted should this be required. Market feedback will be absorbed and implemented where necessary and more sporting codes added on a regular basis. As the solution requires key IP per sporting code, the initial drive will be initiated by the team with the intention to enhance the up-take process in the first year to a point where taking on new sports mainly being configuration and very little development work.

In conjunction, two key sub-systems will be built: an advertising engine that will drive the classified advertising across the platform and also an online shopping mall. The timing of these will be based on usage levels, as there are alternative ways to deal with these two sub-solutions at lower usage levels that do not require significant work from a technology perspective.

# Timeline

The below timeline is a proposed timeline based on raising the full funding from the TOKEN SALE. Once the TOKEN SALE is completed, this will be reviewed and, if need be, adjusted. Dates are set as to-be-completed-by dates, and depending on logistics and impact, may move slightly.
