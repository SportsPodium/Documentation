# How SportsPodium came about

Sport is a sector that generates more than 1 trillion US$ a year in revenues. This includes salaries, sponsorships, advertising, services and product sales.

Since early times sport has gripped the imagination of civilizations, whether it be gladiators fighting to death, or the ancient Olympics. It’s been so right up to what we have today.

Humans want to compete. This is how sport has evolved. Yet, it is only a very small portion of the world’s population that actually has access to real sporting opportunities.

The major sports codes have long been implementing a top to bottom business approach. The way they manage their sport is to ensure players have as much opportunity as possible. At least, that is what we are given to understand. Whatever the real story, sport is a vast business, and the current structure lends itself to exclusivity and enrichment of a few while the impression gets created that the amateur ethos still applies.

Sport has the ability to unite and inspire people. But it is only a small percentage of the world’s population that currently have access to the many types of sports there are at many levels. This is something we want to change and which we have been thinking about a great deal. It is how we have come up with the idea of an online sports library that is run on business lines but which serves to open sports to amateurs and professionals alike.

SportsPodium is intended to offer a solution to challenges across the spectrum. The intention is to undo the status quo through the use of social media. It is to get a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach to spotting talent and indeed to running the whole business of sport. What’s more, we want to open revenue opportunities right along the value chain.

Sports administrators themselves stand to gain from SportsPodium. It will help them gather information and so enable them to identify talent more effectively. At the same time it will on their part give sports people the chance to promote themselves, and do so in a fun and engaging way.

Imagine a system that allows equal access to opportunities, revenue streams, information, talent and products, and to services that are more transparent and fair in distributing income among all who participate! Players, coaches, administrators and governing bodies will all benefit and so will the sports fan and supporter.

Through the use and combination of disruptive mechanisms and algorithms, an online sports resource platform and Cryptocurrency has been created; a world first for technology and sport in business. The crypto tokens will be called PODs. Based on their value in the community, users of SportsPodium will earn these PODS through coin mining as well as the other usual revenue streams outlined below. This token will facilitate purchases of a wide variety ranging from services to products, advertising space, information and ticket sales.

SportsPodium’s PODs will be the equalizer for the sports world, causing disruption of the existing flow of money. Income will be shared equally and transparently by those who have the belief, passion and drive for the industry.

# Background To SportsPodium

SportsPodium is an incentivized online global sports resource platform. The aim is to introduce non-technical users into the world of Blockchain and cryptocurrency through an easy-to-use decentralized mobile application.

The application was first launched in 2014 as MyRugbyCV.com with two years of research and development behind it. 2014 to 2016 saw two further versions released. It is fully functional and has 7000 registered users. This serves as ‘Proof of Concept stage’ of the SportsPodium project.

Since 2016, we have been investigating the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency environment. A number of key problems faced in the Web 2.0 approach have been solved. PODs will reward the community for behaviours and participation.

# What is SportsPodium?

SportsPodium is a talent identification and player management system for the sports industry incentivizing participants through a loyalty program which issues tokens directly into the end-user’s crypto wallet. This will ultimately serve to thin the line between business and sport.

SportsPodium’s focus will be to structure information in the sports world into an easy to use application beneficial to the user. SportsPodium will work similar to LinkedIn. Aimed at the sporting community. Users will act as curators and will validate the information by means of regular input.

> Our consensus algorithm has been developed over the past 5 years. It was tested in real world scenarios with 7000 subscribers at rugby tournaments involving hundreds of players and teams. The top players of the tournaments were identified and rewarded based on our algorithms.
> During the last year of testing, two teams of 22 players were selected for an international tour using our system, following the process as described in this document.

A key driver for accurate curation will be users in the sports industry, measured on the basis of reputation earned through time and active involvement on the platform.

SportsPodium’s talent identification algorithms are unique. The higher your allocated reputation and input, the more influence you have on various aspects of the algorithm.

The system allows sports players to capture their statistics after each game, practice or training session. Coaches will rate their players ( Low impact on talent identification algorithm as they might be biased to players ) after each event and most importantly recommend players from opposing teams. ( High Impact on talent identification algorithm ).

The key incentivizing drivers for participants to upload their data will
be:

**Diligence:** Players, coaches, teams, clubs/schools and administrators who diligently enter their data will be incentivized. The SportsPodium algorithms will execute multipliers to incentivize the more diligent participants in order to encourage continued usage of the system.

**Accuracy:** Accurate information in the system is vital. Consensus algorithms are used to measure the accuracy of the data in the system. Higher reputation of participants is gained on the degree of accurate data captured into the system. Reputation is a key part of the algorithm incentivizing participants.

**Performance:** The main aim of SportsPodium is to ultimately identify upcoming talent in the early stages of their sporting careers. Good performance will ensure greater incentives for the participant.

Much like Facebook, The SportsPodium platform will allow users to post videos and pictures of the sporting events; it will allow users to banter on Banter boards and it will also allow users to publish information into the community in the form of blogging articles.

The users will be incentivised on the same principle that can be seen on the steemit.com, where users get paid to blog. The look and feel of the solution will have a resemblance to Facebook in order to assist the non-technical users.

# How SportsPodium Go About Building An Integrated Sports Community:

The next step in the evolution of the product is to rebuild the application as a Decentralized Application (DAPP) on proven Blockchain Technology. Crypto Financing, (via an Initial Token Offering) will be used for growth capital, rather than traditional venture capital and/or shareholders.

SportsPodium will be seen as the LinkedIn and Facebook for the sporting community. The ‘cherry on the top’ will be a cleverly built advertising engine and virtual shopping mall that will earn the participant and sports community revenue.

Users will become accustomed to receiving and acting on mobile notifications. The system will drive the process through smart contracts to ensure all concerned complete actions required of them throughout the process. As users participate in the process they will receive incentives in the form of tradable crypto-tokens.

Most importantly, the end-users will be allowed to easily convert their crypto tokens into a fiat currency of their choice.

# Revenue Models:

Whilst the earning of currency is an initial selling point and motivator for participation, a number of more traditional revenue streams will be built into the platform to augment and then replace this revenue stream. Through the use of smart contracting, revenues will be generated. These will then be redistributed to the initiator, the community as a whole and the organization that will build and grow the SportsPodium platform.

# Reward Pool Distribution:

In order to ensure SportsPodium users actively participate in their duties as part of the process, each user will receive rewards for doing their usual tasks by entering or data into the SportsPodium Blockchain. The Blockchain will generate daily loyalty rewards in the form of cryptocurrency tokens, which will be added to a reward pool.

Users will receive their share of the reward pool based on their reputation and also diligence. A percentage of the daily reward pool will be allocated to a SportsPodium crypto Wallet in order to ensure that the system can be enhanced and maintained. The platform will be properly marketed via a strong team to ensure success.

# Advertising:

With a captive community, hyper targeting will be used to market sporting equipment and services in the form of advertising and sponsorship models. This model can be aimed at the various hierarchical levels within the system. Combined with predictable sports seasons, local shops and virtual shopping malls can be optimized via advertisements. Advertising revenue will form part of the community split back reward, based on the specific geographical area where the advertisements are placed.

A dvertising will happen from club, team or player level onto national and international level. All levels will be able to use current sponsors or advertisers or enlist new ones through the platform.

Advertisers and sponsors will need to buy PODs to be able to pay for this, ensuring active demand for the cryptocurrency.

# Freemium:

SportsPodium will generate revenue from a standard freemium model.

The use of the system will be free, but a premium can be charged for specialized services. Typical premium services will include:

* Data mining services to identify talent.
* Promotional services for exceptional and high-performance athletes.
* Statistical analysis of information for sports administration and control bodies.
* Advanced entity website features.
* Tournament and event management options.

# Online Store:

This concept can be described as a crypto currency friendly Amazon Online for sports. Retailers will pay to feature on the platform. Various revenue generating opportunities including delivery, warehousing, and managing of retail space will exist.

International brands and local manufacturers will be targeted. These brands and entities will be able to geo target, based on their distribution capability, or explore new markets not previously accessible to them.
